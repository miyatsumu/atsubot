__Key Commands__
  > `mbprefix <string>` - change the prefix from $ to anything less than 5 characters. This variable is stored on a per-server level. This command does not use a prefix!
  > `$help` - get this page.
  > `$info` - get info on the bot.
  > `$blacklist [channel-name]` - block or unblock a channel from sending commands. If the bot has sufficient rights, it will also remove any commands in blacklisted channels.

__Reminder Commands__
  > `$del` - delete reminders and intervals on your server.
  > `$remind [user/channel] <time-to-reminder> <message>` - set up a reminder. Takes times in the format of [num][s/m/h/d], for example 10s for 10 seconds or 2s10m for 2 seconds 10 minutes. An exact time can be provided as `day`/`month`/`year`-`hour`:`minute`:`second`.
  > `$interval [user/channel] <time-to-reminder> <interval> <message>` - set up an interval, where the given `message` will be sent every `interval` starting in the given `time-to-reminder`. Takes times in the formats above. Ex. `$interval 0s 20m Hello World!` will send `Hello World!` to your channel every 20 minutes.
  > `$todo` - TODO list related commands. Use `$todo help` for proper information.
  > `$todos` - same as `$todo` but for server-wide task management.
  > `timezone` - set your server's timezone, for easier date-based reminders (experimental)
